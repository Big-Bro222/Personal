# 1.C# preprocessor directives

## Defining symbols

You use the following two preprocessor directives to define or undefine symbols for conditional compilation， these is mostly combine will the conditional compilation:

- `#define`: Define a symbol.
- `#undef`: Undefine a symbol.

## Conditional compilation

You use four preprocessor directives to control conditional compilation:

- `#if`: Opens a conditional compilation, where code is compiled only if the specified symbol is defined.
- `#elif`: Closes the preceding conditional compilation and opens a new conditional compilation based on if the specified symbol is defined.
- `#else`: Closes the preceding conditional compilation and opens a new conditional compilation if the previous specified symbol isn't defined.
- `#endif`: Closes the preceding conditional compilation.

You can use the operators `==` (equality)]and `!=` (inequality)]to test for the `bool` 
values `true`or `false`. `true`means the symbol is defined. The statement `#if DEBUG`
 has the same meaning as `#if (DEBUG == true)`. You can use the [&&` 
 operators to evaluate whether multiple symbols have been defined. You can also group symbols and operators with parentheses.

```csharp
#define MYTEST
using System;
public class MyClass
{
    static void Main()
    {
#if (DEBUG && !MYTEST)
        Console.WriteLine("DEBUG is defined");
#elif (!DEBUG && MYTEST)
        Console.WriteLine("MYTEST is defined");
#elif (DEBUG && MYTEST)
        Console.WriteLine("DEBUG and MYTEST are defined");  
#else
        Console.WriteLine("DEBUG and MYTEST are not defined");
#endif
    }
}
```

## Defining regions

You can define regions of code that can be collapsed in an outline using the following two preprocessor directives: `#region` `#endregion`

```csharp
#region MyClass definition
public class MyClass
{
    static void Main()
    {
    }
}
#endregion
```

## Error and warning information

You instruct the compiler to generate user-defined compiler errors and warnings, and control line information using the following directives:

- `#error`: Generate a compiler error with a specified message.
- `#warning`: Generate a compiler warning, with a specific message.
- `#line`: Change the line number printed with compiler messages.

```csharp
#error Deprecated code in this method.

#warning Deprecated code in this method.
```

## Pragmas

This has been used in shaders to define the function name of vertex shader and fragment shader

```csharp
#pragma pragma-name pragma-arguments
```

| UNITY_ASSERTIONS | #define directive for assertions control process. |

## 2.2 Unity versions

UNITY_X, UNITY_X_Y and UNITY_X_Y_Z. for any unity release version

| Property: | Function: |

## 2.3 Others

| Property: | Property: |
| --- | --- |
| CSHARP_7_3_OR_NEWER | Defined when building scripts with support for C# 7.3 or newer. |
| ENABLE_MONO | Scripting backend #define for Mono. |
| ENABLE_IL2CPP | Scripting backend #define for IL2CPP. |
| NET_2_0 | Defined when building scripts against .NET 2.0 API compatibility level on Mono and IL2CPP. |

| ENABLE_WINMD_SUPPORT | Defined when Windows Runtime support is enabled on IL2CPP. See Windows Runtime Support for more details. |

Note: Remember to validate the code before compiling if it’s not included in the current editor context. Or it will cause errors when building the application.

It is also possible to add to the built-in selection of #define directives by supplying your own. Open the **Other Settings** panel of the Player settings and navigate to the **Scripting Define Symbols**
 text box.
