 ADB Debug

This is a record for understanding some of the ADB command that could be useful for ADB debugging:

```csharp
adb connect 127.0.0.1: (Device portal)

adb devices (check the current connection status)

adb shell ：use linux command for operation, after adb shell, we will be entering adb shell and operate as linux command（In Android shell , we can use "exit" command to exit）

adb install [path]

adb uninstall [package name]：
```

## Package interaction

```csharp

adb shell pm list package (list all the package installed in the device)
adb shell pm list packages -s (list all system package installed in the device）
adb shell pm list package -3 (list all third-party package installed in the device）

Explanation: use adb shell go to the inner linux system and call the pm function: which is the pm script inside the system/bin

```

## Activity interaction

```csharp
To start the application, you will need to active the "start" activity to accomplish that.
(Here activity refers to a component in Android development)(https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/intro-activities)

adb shell am start -W -S [Package name]/[activity to start the application]
adb shell am force-stop com.tenda.smarthome.app (force stop application)

adb pull [Android path][Computer path] （Download Android file to PC）
adb exec-out screencap -p > sc.png  (ScreenShot to save on PC)
adb shell screenrecord /sdcard/filename.mp4  (Screen recording, Ctrl+c can end the screen recording, default is 180s)

adp push[Computer path][Android path] (Upload PC file to Android)
```

## Open Current Activity interface

```csharp
adb shell dumpsys activity|findstr “mFocuse”

adb shell monkey -p [package name] -v-v -v1 

     通过查看日志信息中，找到using开头的那一句，其中的activity名字就是启动界面

adb 使用 sdk 中的aapt工具来进行apk包的解析  
```

## Input

```csharp
adb shell input text [content]

adb shell input tap [x，y]

adb shell input keyevent [keycode]

adb shell input swipe [startingX startingY endX endY operationTime(s)] (Long press is simulated by a short-distance&long-duration press)
adb shell input keyevent --longpress 26 (also long press event)

By wrting these operation into a text and write as a bat file could implement a very simple auto test script!
```
