              We found out that there are problems for people delivering well in
              town. We have delivery services in long-distance, what about in
              the same city? People always have problems delivering stuff in the
              same city. The only existing solution is to ask help from friends
              or bring the item by themselves.

                  Is there any situation that people would prefer to pay money

              prototypes.

            <p className="description">
              According to our test objects, they thought that the map view is
              more intuitive and they need the information of location as
              essential information. So we decide to use the map view
              interaction as the main one.

              use a ballpoint pen instead of a pencil. We then did a heuristic

              In this design project, we truly searched for an interesting
              problem that doesn't have many solutions in the current market. I
              found building an "interactive" paper prototype useful, which is
              fast and more intuitive than the traditional paper prototype. What
              makes me surprised is that we conducted several iteration loops
              and still can find errors. This makes me realize the importance of
              iteration.
