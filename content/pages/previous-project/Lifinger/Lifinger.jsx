                            People always have problems delivering stuff in the same city.
                            The only existing solution is to ask help from friends or bring the item by themselves.

                            We defined two different types of interaction.
                            One is list view another is the map view.
                            We ended in conflicts about which is more practical.
                            So we conducted user evaluation to test both prototypes.

                            According to our test objects,
                            they thought that the map view is more intuitive and they need the information of location as essential information.
                             So we decide to use the map view interaction as the main one.

                            At first, we conduct user testing with five users to fix the system.
                            Also, according to their feedback we decided to use a ballpoint pen instead of a pencil.
                            We then did a heuristic evaluation to further investigate our system breakdowns.

                            In this design project,
                            we truly searched for an interesting problem that doesn't have many solutions in the current market.
                            I found building an "interactive" paper prototype useful,
                            which is fast and more intuitive than the traditional paper prototype.
                            What makes me surprised is that we conducted several iteration loops and still can find errors.
                            This makes me realize the importance of iteration.</p>
